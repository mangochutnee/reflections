What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a hidden folder labeled .git that contains the metadata git needs to work it magic.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a temporary holding space that collects the files you specify that will go into the next commit. It's a way to decide what information each commit contains rather than committing every file from your working directory straight to the repository.
