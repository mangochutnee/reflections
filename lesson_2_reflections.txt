What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a hidden folder labeled .git that contains the metadata git needs to work it magic.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a temporary holding space that collects the files you specify that will go into the next commit. It's a way to decide what information each commit contains rather than committing every file from your working directory straight to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only those files that equate to one logical change to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some examples: when I want to try something experimental and I'm not sure how it will affect the code; when I want to create a different version of the app but leave the original one alone; when I'm working with an agile team and different developers are working on different stories.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They helped understand that branches are recorded historically. The diagrams also helped show which commits were unreachable because they physically could not be traced back to a branch.
