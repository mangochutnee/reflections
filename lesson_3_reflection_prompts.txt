When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Usually when working with others, either through a private repo with your own team or an open source repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pull when it makes the most sense in your workflow, generally between commits or when someone else has pushed a major commit. You don't want Git automatically updating for you and overwriting your most recent changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Copy a GitHub repo into your GitHub profile. Use when you want to create a different version of someone else's existing repo and you want to give them credit.
Clone: Copy a GitHub repo onto your local machine. Use when you want to work directly with that repo.
Branch: Create a new set of commits that deviates from the master branch. Use when you want to make new or experimental commits to your current repo that won't affect master/production.
